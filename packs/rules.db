Similarly, a character suffering a –1 penalty from the daze spell cannot suffer an additional daze while the first one is in effect.</p>\n<p>A spell already cast on a target is completely unaffected by an additional copy of the same spell cast on the same target. Another casting does not, for example, extend the duration of the effect. It instead does nothing at all. For example, a mage under the effects of rock armor cannot cast rock armor again five minutes before the first casting’s expiration to effectively extend the duration. The mage must wait for the first casting to expire and then cast it again.</p>\n<p>The above is true even when a target is suffering only partial or reduced effects of a spell because they resisted an earlier casting.

{"_id":"Z9mQvKmOdAe3wA1i","name":"Statistics","content":"<p>Each organization, group, or realm has a number of abilities that represent its power and resources in various areas. These are rated on a scale similar to PC ability scores, with –2 or worse being very poor and 4 or greater being exceptional. Most organizations will have scores in the 0 to 5 range, though those with exceptionally powerful or weak aspects will have ability scores above or below this range. There are five abilities for realms and organizations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Might </strong>represents military power, armed guards, and other things an organization can use to attack others or defend its holdings from physical assault. Might need not be a dedicated or standing garrison; a merchant house with a long-standing contract with group of mercenaries would use its Might to reflect this. Large noble houses and military orders tend to have high Might.</li>\n<li><strong>Wealth </strong>represents buying power and riches. Stores of gold, valuable goods, and significant assets all help determine Wealth. Note that this score represents assets that can be actively used in play; a noble house whose riches are mostly tied up in long-term investments or with significant expenses might have low Wealth. Merchant houses and noble houses with many holdings usually have high Wealth.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence </strong>is a measure of political power. Allies in various kingdoms, secrets with political value, and friends among influential groups like the Chantry or Templar Order are included in Influence. Like Wealth, Influence only represents what an organization can throw around to make things happen; an ancient noble house with few modern allies might be respected and yet still have low Influence. High Influence is possessed by many large and successful organizations with noble houses and merchants often having exceptionally high scores.</li>\n<li><strong>Intrigue </strong>is all about intelligence gathering, secrets, and underhanded operations. Whereas Influence tends to happen out in the open, Intrigue is what goes on in the shadows and behind closed doors. Spies, little black tomes full of dirty secrets, and similar resources help determine Intrigue. Public organizations with no hidden arm such as most city watches and small town governments have low Intrigue. Conversely, secret orders or covert organizations attached to more public entities have high Intrigue, as do many criminal organizations.</li>\n<li><strong>Magic </strong>determines the mystical resources. Potions, spellcasters, enchanters, and magic items all contribute to an organizations’ Magic. It can also represent access to materials used in enchantment and potion-crafting like elfroot or lyrium. Many organizations not focused on magical study or resources have low Magic, though many do have a mage on retainer or some enchanted items around to help protect them from mystical assault. Magic-heavy organizations such as the Circle of Magi and apostate factions have high Magic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these abilities, there are four other secondary abilities organizations have; Structure, Stability, Focus, and Scope.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Structure </strong>represents how well put together an organization is, making it harder to destabilize or undermine.</li>\n<li><strong>Stability </strong>represents how much damage can be done to an organization before it collapses into ruin and chaos. In character- oriented terms, Structure is akin to an Armor Rating and Stability to Health.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus </strong>works like a character’s focus and reflects specialized traits that help an organization perform certain tasks. Various focus examples will be described shortly.</li>\n<li><strong>Scope</strong>, is a measure of the group’s size. Not all organizations are created equal. A small-town bandit gang might be a big deal among the settlements in a region, but they pale in comparison to the might of the Orlesian Empire or even a medium-sized syndicate from a major city such as Kirkwall. Some of this difference in power is represented in other ability scores, but there is also Scope. Scope is rated in four categories: Local, Regional, National, or dragonage-compendia. It determines how wide the organization’s reach is, and acts as a bonus when trying to affect things smaller than themselves. Local covers a town or small city, Regional covers part of a nation or a large city like Denerim or Kirkwall. National deals with everything within the borders of a nation like Nevarra or Orlais, while World is reserved for kingdoms and other organizations who can affect large areas of Thedas with their power.</li>\n</ul>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GuWaVD2A6oiSLcIR":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.v1EqdnCqeLCIgFBV"},"cf":{"id":"temp_z53hr0vuwv"}}}

{"_id":"fSUQaIypYv3bOXky","name":"Plots","content":"<p>Plots are actions that represent the organization using its resources to affect another organization. This could be a physical raid on someone else’s territory, trying to ruin their reputation with false rumors and fake evidence, robbing them of vital business opportunities, or any number of other possibilities. Successful plots hurt their targets and often strengthen the plotting organization. Unsuccessful plots do the opposite.</p>\n<p>To make a plot action, the organization makes an opposed test with its target. Any appropriate focuses give each party a +2 bonus to their rolls. If the attacking organization wins, it does 2d6 + the ability used damage to the defending organization’s Stability. Structure acts as armor against this result, reducing Stability lost by the rating. If the defender wins, the attacker takes the same damage to its Stability. The winner gains SP equal to their Dragon Die result if they roll doubles, to spend on the <strong>Plot Stunts table</strong> at the bottom.</p>\n<p>The ability used depends on the nature of the plot or defense. For example, theft, spying, and other sneaky endeavors would use Intrigue while sending troops to raid and burn someone’s holdings uses Might. Note that sometimes an organization will attempt a plot that involves a third party, such as supplying an organization’s rivals with potions and other mystical gear to better oppose them. That’s fine; just use the appropriate abilities and perform the test as normal. This is especially important with PC organizations; you don’t want to push them to the side just because they’ve decided to hire, bribe, and convince someone else to do their dirty work, but it might change what ability scores are used. If a justification for using a particular ability is too far-fetched, the GM should disallow it and require the use of another ability.</p>\n<h2>Frequency of Plots</h2>\n<p>It’s generally a good idea to allow no more than one plot action a game session to keep things from getting bogged down, though if a session covers a long period of in-game time a GM could allow more than one. Conversely, a session that covers a short period of time or ends with a cliffhanger that runs right into the next session might not have any plot actions. Essentially GMs should allow these actions when it makes sense that the PCs and their organization would have time to enact them.</p>\n<h2>Long Involved Plots</h2>\n<p>Sometimes an organization has a plan to destroy or undermine another organization that’s elaborate and will take a lot of time and effort. In such cases, just break up the overall scheme into various plot actions and conduct each one separately. If one of these actions fails along the way, the PCs or GM running the organization will have to decide if the organization changes plans and tactics or tries again. This is also attractive because it allows an organization to chain together a number of plots which could ultimately destroy a foe utterly or greatly increase their own power but which are thematically consistent and create a unified narrative. Of course, the other organization won’t just stand around, and might do some plotting of their own.</p>\n<h2>Other Actions</h2>\n<p>Plots cover most everything an organization will want to do involving things outside their own growth and development. However, there might be a few incidents where the organization wants to do something that doesn’t quite fit the contested nature of a plot action. They might want to acquire a large amount of a particular resource to assist the PCs in an adventure or to put on a festival or tournament to impress the locals.</p>\n<p>In such cases, it’s usually easiest to look at the organization’s abilities and decide how well they can accomplish such tasks. A poor merchant house might be able to secure a small amount of a rare good, but more is out of their reach without engaging in a plot or adventure to grab it from someone else.</p>\n<p>A well-to-do noble house can likely put on an impressive tournament, though a grand tourney the likes of which the nation has never seen requires some special action. If there’s any doubt whether an organization can do something, the GM should call for a test and set a difficulty, but in most cases it’s better just to decide on a reasonable result and move things along.</p>\n<h2>Scope and Plots</h2>\n<p>Every organization has a Scope, and it makes a big difference when it launches plots against others operating at a smaller or larger Scope. For every difference in Scope (Local to Regional, Regional to National, National to World) the larger organization gets a +2 bonus to the plot action test. However, it also costs 2 additional stunt points to perform a stunt per difference in Scope. It’s easier for a large organization to overwhelm and push around smaller institutions, but they get less out of it when they do. Conversely, it’s harder for small organizations to affect larger ones. Even large organizations of modest power can crush local kingpins, powerbrokers, and noble houses. In fact, that reality defines a lot of the political and economic relationships in Thedas. On the other hand, if a smaller organization gets the better of a larger organization, they get a bonus as their daring grows their own power by attracting new allies, recruits, and aid.</p>\n<p>These victories rarely weaken the larger organization much, but often do wonders for the smaller. To reflect this, for every Scope they are below their opponent, the organization winning a plot action test gets a +2 bonus and receives 2 free SPs to spend with their next Growth check. This makes plots by small groups against larger organizations very attractive, but they also risk drawing the ire of an institution with far superior resources. This too reflects the political and economic realities of Thedas.</p>\n<h2>Organizational Ruin</h2>\n<p>An organization that loses all its Stability or has had all its abilities reduced to 0 or less is in ruins. It’s basically dead and will completely collapse unless the PCs step in and succeed at some last desperate attempt to save it. Such actions are always the focus of an adventure, and PCs might even be called to do this for organizations that aren’t theirs. If this last-ditch attempt to save it succeeds, the organization immediately gains 2d6 Stability and 1 rank in two abilities of the PCs’ choice. It’s still in sorry shape, but it still exists.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:442px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:100%;height:17px\" colspan=\"2\"><strong>Plot Stunts</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.5657%;text-align:center;height:17px\">1+</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.4343%;height:17px\">Bolster: Add extra Stability equal to the SPs spent.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.5657%;text-align:center;height:17px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.4343%;height:17px\">Further Advantage: Gain a +2 bonus in the next plot action test against this same opponent.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:10.5657%;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.4343%\">Disorganize: Pick a Focus; the opponent cannot use it in its next plot action.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.5657%;text-align:center;height:68px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.4343%;height:68px\">Embarrass: You taunt or ridicule your foe publicly with the state, local religious officials, or the people.

A decent set of trap-making tools costs 10 sp and the cost of materials for a given trap depends on the magnitude of the trap as shown in the table.</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:133px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:27px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:99.5702%;height:27px\" colspan=\"3\">\n<h3><strong>Trap Material Costs</strong></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:10px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:26.5225%;height:10px\"><strong>TN</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:37.9984%;height:10px\"><strong>Base Damage Desired</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;width:35.0493%;height:10px\"><strong>Cost of Materials</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.5225%;height:16px;text-align:center\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width:37.9984%;height:16px;text-align:center\">1d6</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.0493%;height:16px;text-align:center\">1sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.5225%;height:16px;text-align:center\">11</td>\n<td style=\"width:37.9984%;height:16px;text-align:center\">2d6</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.0493%;height:16px;text-align:center\">10sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.5225%;height:16px;text-align:center\">13</td>\n<td style=\"width:37.9984%;height:16px;text-align:center\">3d6</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.0493%;height:16px;text-align:center\">20sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.5225%;height:16px;text-align:center\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width:37.9984%;height:16px;text-align:center\">4d6</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.0493%;height:16px;text-align:center\">50sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.5225%;height:16px;text-align:center\">17</td>\n<td style=\"width:37.9984%;height:16px;text-align:center\">5d6</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.0493%;height:16px;text-align:center\">1gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.5225%;height:16px;text-align:center\">19</td>\n<td style=\"width:37.9984%;height:16px;text-align:center\">6d6</td>\n<td style=\"width:35.0493%;height:16px;text-align:center\">10gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Most trap makers carry a kit of materials with them, which should be abstracted and described simply by its total value in coin. The kit may consist of strange solvents, miniature clockworks, ragged blades, sharp darts, and other assorted other dangerous bits. Players are encouraged to describe these components in as much or as little detail as they wish. As these raw materials are deployed the value of the kit is reduced by their value. If and as those traps are taken back apart their value is increased by the same amount. The Game Master should apply sense and reason to the amount of weight and bulk in raw materials a trap maker can carry on their person, on their horse, in their wagon, and so on.</p>\n<p>A trap maker who fails to set a trap must make an additional Dexterity (Crafting) test, at the same target number, to see whether their raw materials are ruined in the attempt. On a success, they are not. On a failure, they are rendered useless. The materials to build a trap can also often be scavenged from the area by a clever or determined trap maker. This requires a Cunning (Natural Lore) or Perception (Searching) test with the same target number as is required to build a trap of that magnitude. Success means that the trap maker need not deplete that trap’s value from their kit when setting it, whether they succeed or fail. A trap maker parted from their kit can scavenge materials this way as well. The exact nature of a particular trap is left to the imagination of the player and the arbitration of the GM. The difference between spiked pits, biting metal jaws, and icy shrapnel driven by exploding frostrock is mechanically irrelevant.</p>\n<p>See @JournalEntry[TOFxXHIGYzpWzTno]{Additional Effects} for options to enhance crafted traps.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GuWaVD2A6oiSLcIR":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_h8h39b6km0o"}}}
{"_id":"kJ5nJnhfLzSm7f2a","name":"Using Poisons","content":"<p>Unless a given poison’s description says otherwise, poison can be inflicted on unfortunate victims either by ingestion or by coating a bladed weapon in the stuff and stabbing them with it. Grenades are used by throwing them with enough force to destroy the glass flasks in which they’re carried.</p>\n<p>Some creatures may be immune to the effects of certain poisons, or of all poisons. Because each poison differs from others and every creature is different, the GM is always the arbiter of these immunities. In general, the GM should consider potential immunities logically rather than biologically. For example, the incorporeal nature of shades and ash wraiths would logically render them immune to the effects of toxins. As another example, although genlocks, ghouls, and blight wolves are all Blight-tainted, nothing about their physical nature suggests that they should be immune to the effects of poisons.</p>\n<p>Those with the @Compendium[dragonage-compendia.talents.PIHd9V135a1Cbces]{Poison-Making} talent are able to use poisons and grenades in combat without endangering themselves or their allies. They’ve been taught how to carry glass flasks with due care, how to avoid nicking themselves with toxic blades, and where best to stab and cut their enemies to ensure poisons do their work quickly and effectively. Those without that talent can try to use grenades and poisons, but run the risk of disaster when they do. </p>\n<p>When a character without the Poison-Making talent tries to coat a weapon with poison they must make a <strong>Cunning (Poison Lore) test TN 13</strong>. They suffer a –3 penalty if battle has already begun. If the test is failed, the poison does not coat the weapon and the character immediately suffers both its basic damage (penetrating as always) and additional effects. Even if the test is passed, the character (or anyone using their imperfectly coated weapon) must spend 4 stunt points rather than 2 to perform the @Compendium[dragonage-compendia.stunts.1qZu03BYGI1nPunf]{Envenom}stunt.</p>\n<p>You can coat a single melee weapon (from the Dueling, Light Blades, or Spears Groups) or three arrows/bolts with an activate action. This uses up one dose of poison and both the poison and the weapon must be readied. This can be done prior to combat, but no more than one minute before the encounter begins. Once applied, a poison’s effectiveness on a weapon lasts for the duration of a combat encounter only (whether because it drips off, is worn away by a scabbard, or sees its effectiveness degrade through exposure to the air or elements). A single weapon may only be coated with a single type of poison at a time, and only with a single dose of the stuff. That is, doses can’t be “doubled up.”</p>\n<p>The poison is delivered by means of a special stunt, @Compendium[dragonage-compendia.stunts.1qZu03BYGI1nPunf]{Envenom}, which can be used by any character attacking with a poisoncoated weapon. Note that a single enemy can only suffer the effects of a given type of poison once per encounter. “Concentrated” poisons are distinct from their non-concentrated counterparts for these (and other) purposes.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GuWaVD2A6oiSLcIR":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_sl6v9lpdt9p"}}}
